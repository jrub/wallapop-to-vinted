# 4. Extract the Page Object layer + introduce HTML fixture testing

Date: 2026-04-26
Status: Partially superseded (2026-05-03) — Page Object extraction stands; the fixture-driven selector-test pattern was rolled back. See Step 7. The ADR-0005 pre-flight pattern subsumes the original "books scanner" use case.

## Research

Reviewed 2026-04-25 (WebFetch + targeted reading) before drafting this ADR. Persisted here so future maintainers don't have to re-investigate.

- **Fowler, "PageObject"** (https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html): the canonical write-up describes the pattern's interface and benefits but **does not address unit-testing of Page Objects**. The implicit assumption is that POMs are consumed by tests, not tested as units.
- **Playwright official guidance** (https://playwright.dev/docs/pom): POMs are injected into E2E specs via `test.extend` fixtures. `page.set_content(html)` exists in the API and is mentioned in the docs for component-style testing, but the POM pages explicitly recommend exercising the object through real navigations.
- **Tutorial sources** (Sudolabs, NashTech, BrowserStack guides reviewed): all describe the same pattern — POMs consumed by real-navigation E2E. None propose testing POMs against captured HTML.

**Orthodox conclusion**: test Page Objects only indirectly, through end-to-end runs.

**Why we deviate** (deliberate, scoped):

1. **Live E2E against Vinted is gated by DataDome.** Every navigation can trigger a captcha — non-deterministic, slow, unsuitable for an automated suite. Re-running the same test 50× in 5 seconds against a fixture is feasible; running 50× against Vinted is not.
2. **The 2 known bugs are pure selector issues.** They reproduce deterministically against captured HTML, which makes fixture-driven TDD a strict win for *those specific cases*: write red test → fix selector → verify green → ship. Iterating without a fixture means iterating against `--limit 1 --visible`, paying DataDome risk and minutes per cycle.
3. **ARIA snapshots** (Playwright `expect(...).to_match_aria_snapshot(...)`): a forward-looking technique surfaced during the research. Captures the accessibility tree as YAML — when Vinted reorganizes a form, the snapshot fails loudly. Cheaper than enumerating selectors per verb.

**The deviation does not extend to every verb.** Trivial verbs (`fill_title`, `set_condition` simple) are still validated by `--limit 1 --visible`. The Coverage section below makes the cost/benefit explicit.

## Context

After ADR-0001 (domain layer), ADR-0002 (Wallapop side), and ADR-0003 (Vinted session + error taxonomy), `upload_vinted.py` still concentrates ≈1690 lines mixing DOM selectors with application flow: `login()`, `select_category()`, `set_condition()`, `scan_dynamic_fields()`, `fill_dropdown()`, `fill_combobox()`, `select_package_size()`, `select_no_brand()`, `collect_form_errors()`, `publish_or_draft()`, `retry_draft_item()`, `get_member_url()`, `scrape_drafts()`, plus a handful of helpers (`human_delay`, `human_type`, JS click utilities). This is Phase 4 of the refactor described in ADR-0001: the Page Object layer.

Two concrete bugs are riding along with the refactor and are worth fixing in this phase because they live entirely in the selectors:

1. **Package size**: clicking `[data-testid='2-package-size--cell']` does not propagate to the inner `<input type="radio">`, so Vinted rejects the listing with "Selecciona el tamaño del paquete". Symptom variant: when the category is a non-leaf, the package block is not rendered at all and the current `wait_for(state="visible", timeout=5000)` burns five seconds while Playwright's visibility retry triggers the "scroll absurdo" the user observed in `--visible` mode.
2. **`scan_dynamic_fields` for books**: the current selector (`*-single-list-input`, `*-dropdown-input`) misses the testids Vinted uses for ISBN/Author/Publisher/Language/Format. Books therefore log `Fields detected: []` and fall back to draft. ISBN is the keystone — once filled, Vinted auto-populates the rest.

There is no test infrastructure for the Page Object layer today: the only feedback loop is a real Vinted upload via `python upload_vinted.py --limit 1 --visible`, which is slow, costs a DataDome captcha each time, and is non-deterministic when the upload flow caches state from previous attempts.

## Decision

Extract the Page Object layer into `vinted/pages/` with one module per page (`login.py`, `new_item.py`, `edit_draft.py`, `profile.py`) and a shared helpers module (`_common.py`). Each Page Object is a class that takes a Playwright `page` in its constructor and exposes intent-named verbs (`fill_title`, `select_condition`, `publish_or_draft`) that hide the selectors. Page Objects raise the existing taxonomy from `vinted/errors.py` (`LoginFailed`, `PublishRejected`); the captcha detection wrapper stays in `main()` where the operator-facing exit code translation already lives.

Pure functions still tangled in `upload_vinted.py` (`_extract_item_id_from_url`, `_is_form_url`, `_testid_to_key`, `_normalize_title`, `match_draft_to_item`) move to `domain/` first because they don't depend on the browser and can be tested without `pytest-playwright`.

For testing, this phase **deliberately departs from the orthodox Page Object testing approach** documented in Fowler's bliki and the official Playwright docs. The mainstream guidance is to test Page Objects only indirectly through end-to-end runs that consume them — but in our case every E2E run is a real navigation against Vinted, gated by DataDome, and produces non-deterministic state. We therefore adopt a fixture-HTML approach:

- A new `scripts/capture_vinted_fixtures.py` script, run once per scope by the maintainer in `--visible` mode, navigates to each critical surface (`/items/new`, `/items/<id>/edit`, login error toast, publish error toast, profile draft list) and dumps `page.content()` to `tests/fixtures/vinted_html/<scope>.html`.
- Tests load fixtures with `page.set_content(html)` via `pytest-playwright` and exercise Page Object verbs against the captured DOM. Coverage is **selective**: the two bug-fix scenarios are red→green TDD cases, and a handful of fragile verbs (`scan_dynamic_fields`, combobox strict-match, error parsers) get fixture tests; trivial verbs (`fill_title`, simple `set_condition`) keep being validated by `--limit 1 --visible`.
- One ARIA snapshot test per fixture (`expect(page.locator("body")).to_match_aria_snapshot(...)`) acts as a structural regression detector. When Vinted reorganizes a form, the snapshot fails loudly; the maintainer re-captures, reviews the diff, and updates the snapshot.
- `pytest-playwright>=0.5` is added to `requirements-dev.txt`. Tests that need a browser are tagged `@pytest.mark.playwright` so the existing 149 non-browser tests keep running without Chromium. New `make test-fast` (no browser) and `make test-browser` (browser only) targets sit alongside the existing `make test` (everything).

## Consequences

- **Positive.** The two known bugs (package-size click, books scanner) get reproducible failing tests before the fix lands, which is impossible today. The fixture HTML doubles as a structural regression detector via ARIA snapshots, so a Vinted DOM change announces itself in CI instead of silently breaking uploads. Page Objects become composable for the orchestrator extraction in Phase 5: a fake `page` plus a real `NewItemPage` is enough to dry-run the upload flow end-to-end. The `playwright` marker keeps the fast loop fast — most tests still run without Chromium.
- **Negative.** Fixtures are point-in-time captures. Every meaningful Vinted DOM refresh requires the maintainer to re-run the capture script, review the diff, and re-commit the HTML. ARIA snapshots mitigate this by failing loudly rather than rotting silently, but the manual re-capture step is real ongoing cost. We accept it as cheaper than the alternative (live E2E, captcha-gated, slow). Adding `pytest-playwright` and Chromium to the dev dependency footprint is a non-trivial install cost; the marker split keeps it optional for contributors who only want to run the domain/wallapop/vinted-session tests.
- **Open.** Whether `EditDraftPage` should compose `NewItemPage` (delegate to it for shared verbs like `fill_title` / `publish_or_draft`) or whether both should derive from a shared base mixin is left to the implementation step — the duplication will only become visible when the second module lands. The decision is not load-bearing; either approach removes the same lines from `upload_vinted.py`.

## Progress

**Step 0 — Tooling. ✅ 2026-04-26 (`4a710fa`).** `pytest-playwright>=0.5` added; `scripts/capture_vinted_fixtures.py` skeleton; `make test-fast` / `make test-browser` targets.

**Step 1 — Pure helpers to `domain/`. ✅ 2026-04-26 (`86d8f1b`).** `_extract_item_id_from_url`, `_is_form_url` → `domain/urls.py`. `_normalize_title`, `match_draft_to_item` → `domain/drafts.py`. `_testid_to_key` → `domain/text.py`.

**Step 2 — Fixture infrastructure + first capture. ✅ 2026-04-27 (`ff2960d`, `8b19be3`).** `tests/conftest.py` exposes `load_vinted_fixture(scope)` which loads HTML via `page.set_content(..., wait_until="domcontentloaded")` — the default `"load"` raced against the ~2 MB fixture's external CDN URLs and produced flaky failures. `tests/vinted/pages/test_fixtures.py` parametrised anchor regression test fails loudly when a captured fixture loses its anchor selector. First fixture: `tests/fixtures/vinted_html/new_item.html` (anchor: `input[data-testid='title--input']`).

**Step 2.5 — Login/navigation unblocked (unplanned). ✅ 2026-04-27.** Capturing the fixture broke the live login flow and we burnt 4 commits triangulating DataDome's selectivity:

- `4d35edd` rewrote login with native `locator.click()` + `domcontentloaded` — **broke stealth**. DataDome flagged the CDP-issued mouse events behind `locator.click()`.
- `97e4587` reverted to `_js_click_button` (synthetic `el.click()` via `page.evaluate`) for the 4 login clicks and added `channel="chrome"` to `build_session` (Patchright's full stealth requires real Chrome — bundled "Chrome for Testing" is detectable). Locked the contract with `tests/test_upload_login.py` (2 tests asserting 4× `_js_click_button` and 0× native click in `login()`).
- `6f90b36` propagated `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` to every `page.goto(...)` (the Playwright default `"load"` hung 30 s on Vinted's telemetry-heavy pages) and dropped the post-login `wait_for_url` (after `dcl` the URL is already final). `tests/test_upload_navigation.py` adds an AST check that no future `page.goto` lands without `wait_until=`.
- `d43df90` skips the redundant `/items/new` goto for the first item (bootstrap leaves the browser there).

Lessons that outlive the project:

- Patchright requires `channel="chrome"` for full stealth. Bundled Chromium ("Chrome for Testing") is detectable.
- DataDome distinguishes CDP-driven clicks (`locator.click()`) from synthetic JS clicks (`el.click()` via `page.evaluate`). The latter is stealthier for auth buttons.
- On Vinted, `page.goto(..., wait_until="domcontentloaded")` is the safe default — the `"load"` default hangs on telemetry/analytics requests.

Validated in production: `python upload_vinted.py --limit 1 --visible` publishes 1/1 without DataDome slider. 184 tests green.

**Step 3 — NewItemPage + package-size fix. ✅ DONE (2026-05-01).** `vinted/pages/new_item.py` extracted from `upload_vinted.py`. Package-size bug fixed: now clicks `[data-testid='package_type_selector_2--input']` (radio input) instead of the cell div, with 2 s timeout (was 5 s) so non-leaf fallback returns immediately. Shared utilities (`human_delay`, `human_type`, `js_click_button`, `_PANEL_SELECTOR`) moved to `vinted/pages/_common.py`; `upload_vinted.py` imports them from there. Two new playwright tests (`test_select_package_size_checks_radio_input`, `test_select_package_size_returns_false_when_block_absent`) confirm the fix. Books scanner test (`test_scan_dynamic_fields_finds_isbn_field`) auto-skips until `new_item_books` fixture is captured; capture handler added to `scripts/capture_vinted_fixtures.py`. 186 tests, 1 skipped.

**Step 4 — LoginPage extraction. ✅ DONE (2026-05-01, `2ab1dd0`).** `vinted/pages/login.py` (`LoginPage` class) extracted from `upload_vinted.py:login()`. Credentials are now passed by argument (`LoginPage(page).login(email=, password=, visible=)`), decoupling the page object from `dotenv` so a future orchestrator can wire env-loading separately. Errors switched from `RuntimeError` to `LoginFailed` (the existing exception in `vinted/errors.py`). Captcha handling delegates to `vinted.session.abort_if_captcha` directly — no more `_abort_if_captcha` wrapper inside `login()`. The stealth-contract test (4× `js_click_button`, 0× native click) moved to `tests/vinted/pages/test_login.py` and now patches `vinted.pages.login.js_click_button` instead of the old `upload_vinted._js_click_button`. The navigation AST guard in `tests/test_upload_navigation.py` is parametrised over both `upload_vinted.py` and `vinted/pages/login.py`, so any new `page.goto` without `wait_until=` fails on either file.

**Step 4 (cont.) — ProfilePage + EditDraftPage. ✅ DONE (2026-05-02).**

- `vinted/pages/profile.py` (`ProfilePage`) — owns `get_member_url()` and `scrape_drafts(member_url)`. The 4-fallback chain in `get_member_url` (JWT cookie → URL path → in-page `/api/v2/users/current` fetch → localStorage walker → `/settings/profile` link extraction) is preserved unchanged, including the operator-facing `print` lines, so the user-visible logs are byte-identical pre/post extraction.
- `vinted/pages/edit_draft.py` (`EditDraftPage`) — inherits from `NewItemPage`. The edit form on `/items/<id>/edit` uses the same `data-testid`s as `/items/new`, so every form verb (category, condition, package size, brand, publish/draft) is reused unchanged. The only edit-specific behaviour is split into two methods:
  - `goto(edit_url)` — navigates with `wait_until="domcontentloaded"`.
  - `wait_for_form_loaded(timeout)` — waits for `input[data-testid='title--input']` to become visible; returns `False` on `PlaywrightTimeout`.

  The split lets the orchestrator fire a captcha check (`_abort_if_captcha`) between the navigation and the form-load wait — preserving the original behaviour where DataDome interstitials abort the whole run instead of degrading to "draft did not load".

The navigation AST guard was tightened in the same commit. Previously `_goto_calls` matched any `<x>.goto(...)` call, which broke the parametrised test on `upload_vinted.py` because `EditDraftPage.goto(url)` (a wrapper) was flagged for missing `wait_until`. The guard now only flags calls whose target is `page` (a `Name`) or `self.page` (an `Attribute(self, 'page')`) — i.e. raw Playwright pages. Domain wrappers that encode `wait_until` one level deeper are exempt by design.

`upload_vinted.py`: 984 → 788 lines (-196). Across the day, 1042 → 788 (-254). 191 tests, 1 skipped (`new_item_books` fixture still pending).

**Step 4+ — remaining work for Phase 5.** With every Vinted-side DOM interaction now in a page object, what remains in `upload_vinted.py` is genuinely orchestration: `fill_dynamic_attributes` (combines NewItemPage verbs with category-mapping reads/writes), `upload_item` and `retry_draft_item` (per-item flow), and `main()` (CLI + bootstrap). Phase 5 introduces the `wallapop-to-vinted.py` entry point that owns env loading and item iteration, leaving the per-item flow in domain orchestrators that compose page objects + domain modules.

**Step 5 — Bug #1 closed by removing the call, not fixing the click. ✅ DONE (2026-05-03).** Step 3 fixed the click *target* (radio input rather than the cell `div`), but production observation surfaced a second-order bug: Vinted pre-selects "Mediano" by default, and our click toggled that default off — items shipped as "Pequeño" instead of Mediano. Two fixes were on the table: (a) instrument `--visible` to confirm `radio.is_checked()` and add a short-circuit, (b) drop the call entirely and let Vinted's default stand. Wallapop has no source for package size (`up_to_kg` doesn't map to Vinted's shoebox/moving-box tiers), so we have nothing to override the default *with* in the first place. Option (b) shipped: both `upload_item` and `retry_draft_item` no longer call `select_package_size`. The verb stays on `NewItemPage` (with its tests) for the hypothetical case where Vinted ever stops pre-selecting. Documented in `CLAUDE.md` ("Package size: untouched, Vinted's default applies") and `README.md` ("Known limitations" → Package size).

**Step 6 — Bug #2 status: half-shipped via ADR-0005, half-pending fixture capture. 🟡 IN PROGRESS (2026-05-03). Superseded by Step 7 — see below.** ADR-0005 introduces a pre-flight that gathers the ISBN from the operator before the browser opens and persists it to `attributes.isbn` on the item. That solves the *data-acquisition* half of the books-scanner bug. The *form-write* half — extending `NewItemPage.scan_dynamic_fields` to detect Vinted's ISBN testid so the gathered value lands in the field — is gated on capturing the `new_item_books` fixture in `--visible` mode (the existing red test `test_scan_dynamic_fields_finds_isbn_field` auto-skips until the fixture lands). Capture handler is in `scripts/capture_vinted_fixtures.py:_capture_new_item_books`; the script's broken `from upload_vinted import login` import was fixed in the same commit (`LoginPage(page).login(...)` now, with credentials read from `.env`).

**Step 7 — Fixture-driven selector tests rolled back. ✅ DONE (2026-05-03).** Three forces converged on the same conclusion within hours:

1. **Pre-publish security review (HIGH finding).** `tests/fixtures/vinted_html/new_item.html` (the only captured fixture) was a 2.1 MB dump of `/items/new` containing the maintainer's home address (`Juan Pablo Bonet, 18, Pr C, 50006 Zaragoza`), real name, email, Vinted internal user_id, login, anon_id, and a server-rendered `CSRF_TOKEN` embedded in the SSR JSON payload (`__next_f.push(...)`). The repo was about to go public. Hard-exclusion #11 ("test-only files") doesn't apply when the file's *literal content* is PII — the concern isn't a code-execution path through the test runner.

2. **Product walk-through of what actually shipped.** Of the 8 scopes declared in `SCOPES` in the capture script, only 2 had handlers (`new_item`, `new_item_books`). Of those, `new_item` had exactly one consumer — the parametrised `test_fixture_loads_and_has_anchor` — which is structurally tautological: the capture script *waits* for the anchor `input[data-testid='title--input']` to be visible *before* dumping, and the test then checks that same anchor is present in the dumped file. Every fresh capture passes by construction; the test detects manual fixture editing and nothing else. `new_item_books` had a single skipped consumer (`test_scan_dynamic_fields_finds_isbn_field`) that needed the file to materialise. Net useful coverage from the fixture infrastructure today: 0 tests.

3. **Cost/benefit of the books capture as the first non-tautological consumer.** Discovering the ISBN `data-testid` for the books scanner needs DevTools on a `--visible` session for ~2 minutes — not a 2 MB DOM capture pipeline. A 5-line `page.set_content("<input data-testid='...'>")` test locks the contract afterwards. The fixture infrastructure was built in ADR-0004 expecting many tests per fixture (ARIA snapshots, multi-verb selector suites); none of that materialised, and the ISBN bug didn't motivate it either.

Removed in this step:
- `tests/fixtures/vinted_html/new_item.html` (the leak; ~2 MB blob still in local git history pending `git filter-repo` before push).
- `tests/fixtures/vinted_html/.gitkeep` and the `tests/fixtures/` directory tree (no other fixtures planned).
- `tests/conftest.py` (only contained `load_vinted_fixture` and `FIXTURES_DIR`).
- `tests/vinted/pages/test_fixtures.py` (only contained `test_fixture_loads_and_has_anchor`).
- `test_scan_dynamic_fields_finds_isbn_field` from `tests/vinted/pages/test_new_item.py` plus the bug-#2 docstring header. To reinstate: ~5-line unit test with `page.set_content` once you've found the ISBN testid via DevTools.
- `scripts/capture_vinted_fixtures.py` and the `scripts/` directory entirely. DevTools "Save As → Webpage, complete" covers any future ad-hoc DOM inspection.
- The `scripts/capture_vinted_fixtures.py` entry from `tests/test_upload_navigation.py` `NAVIGATION_SOURCES`.

Kept:
- `pytest-playwright` in `requirements-dev.txt` — the two surviving `@pytest.mark.playwright` tests (`test_select_package_size_*`) still need the `page` fixture.
- The `playwright` marker in `pytest.ini` and the `make test-fast` / `make test-browser` Makefile targets.
- All four page object modules unchanged.
- The historical Steps 0-6 above unedited — they record decisions taken in good faith at the time. The ADR philosophy is "ADRs are never edited after acceptance — a superseding decision gets its own ADR and updates the previous one's status." Status at the top of this ADR has been updated; this Step 7 entry is the superseding decision in-place because it's narrowly scoped (rollback of one already-documented sub-decision, not a new architectural direction).

Test count: 253 passing, 0 skipped (was 255 + 1 skipped). Net loss: the tautological anchor test and the skipped books-fixture test. Net gain: no PII risk, no fixture-refresh maintenance burden, simpler mental model.
